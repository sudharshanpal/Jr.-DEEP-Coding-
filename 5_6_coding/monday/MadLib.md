# 📝 Mad Libs Generator – Jr. DEEP Coding Sample Project

Welcome to the **Mad Libs Generator**! This is a fun and creative Python program where YOU get to help write a silly story by choosing your own words.

## 🤔 What is a Mad Lib?

A **Mad Lib** is a story where you fill in blanks with your own words — like nouns, adjectives, and verbs — without knowing the full story. When your words are added in, it creates a surprise (and often very funny) story!

---

## 🎮 How It Works

1. The program asks you to enter different types of words:
   - Adjectives (words that describe something, like *funny* or *tall*)
   - Nouns (things or people, like *dog* or *school*)
   - Verbs (action words, like *jumped* or *coded*)
   - Emotions, foods, games, places, and celebrities!

2. Once you fill in your answers, the program puts all your words into a special story about a student named **Yourself!**.

3. The final story is printed out — and it's unique every time you play!
